Embedded Systems and design is one of the most growing industry and at a very fast pace. We as Embedded engineers always try to make something innovative and useful for end user as an embedded application. In semester 4 , we are challenged to showcase our skills which we have learnt in past 3 semesters into a reality.  We have learnt various skills such as Working with software platform i.e eclipse ide for C  and C++. In this semester we will do coding with these platform for our final project. The another software tool which we will use in this semester is cloud computing services such as AWS or Thingspeak. Apart from that, in subjects 3025 and 3014 we worked with arduino, beaglebone black for our class assignments. That gave us an exposure to interface between these components and all the requirement to work with these MCU's. While working in labs in semster 1 and 2 we worked with basics of electronics such as power measurement , voltage regulators , ADC and DAC’ And therefore we can use that experience to implement in our capstone project.
